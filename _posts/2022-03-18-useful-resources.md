A list of useful or interesting articles, courses, and blogs relating to data science, neuroscience, AI, and statistics (mostly).

## Courses & Textbooks
### [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/)  
My favorite deep learning course. It covers deep learning across many domains, AI ethics, and why and how deep learning works so well. 
### [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/)  
My favorite (bayesian) statistics course. Taught in R and Stan, but it's been translated to PyMC3, brms, & Julia.
### [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)  
My favorite practical computer science course. I never took a formal CS class, and this covered a lot of useful material.
### [Handbook of Biological Statistics](https://www.biostathandbook.com/)  
A useful handbook for practical statistical testing in biology (and probably lots of fields).
### [Common Statistical Tests are Linear Models](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/)  
Not really a course, but a cool breakdown of how most statistical tests are really just linear models.
### [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw)  
Youtube channel with tons of statistics explanations and tutorials.
### [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown)  
Youtube channel with amazingly visual tutorials for lots of topics including linear algebra, calculus, neural networks, and more.  
### [SentDex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex)  
Youtube channel with tutorials for seemingly anything you could want to do in Python.
### [Intro to Brain-like-AGI Safety](https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/HzcM2dkCq7fwXBej8)
Fascinating textbook/series of articles on artificial general intelligence and what precautions we might want to make when it comes to that technology.
