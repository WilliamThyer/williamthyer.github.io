## 1. Become good at data science.

Learn Python or R, _not_ Matlab. I see way fewer positions that mention Matlab compared to R and especially Python. Take online courses in machine learning and statistics. I highly recommend [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) if you have no CS background, like me. _Don't_ start with deep learning and neural networks. Make sure you understand data science and machine learning fundamentals very well before moving onto deep learning. If you do, I like the [fastai course](https://course.fast.ai/).

## 2. Do data science.

This obviously happens in parallel to step 1. Most psychology research already involves lots of data science elements. You're probably already a better data scientist than you realize. Building and cleaning data sets, data visualization, statistical testing, modelling, predictions, writing, science communication, etc. Emphasize these aspects of your research. Projects and publications will help show your skills on your resume and during interviews. Make a website to showcase your research and side projects. I use the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/) GitHub Page theme.

## 3. Communicate early and often.

Tell your PI/advisor that you're considering doing a summer internship. Some advisors might not let you. I was lucky enough to have a supportive advisor. Tell you're lab mates, fellow grad students, and collaborators. When people know you're interested, they are more likely to tell you about interesting positions they know of.

## 4. Apply to many internships.

Aim to do at least 1 summer internship during your PhD. 2 even is better. Ideally between your 3rd & 4th, and 4th & 5th years. Apply to dozens and dozens of internships. Use job posting sites like [Indeed](indeed.com) or Google Jobs. Check Twitter (search "PhD Internship", "PhD Data Internship", etc.). Ask friends and collaborators who you know went into industry. Connections might be extremely important because, honestly, it can be difficult to convince recruiters that a psychology PhD student would make a data scientist.

## 5. Do your internships.

Do a data science internship! You'll likely learn a lot about putting things into production, collaboration, and actual development. A lot of internships turn into full-time offers. Once you have one or two internships under your belt, you'll be in a much better position when applying for full-time jobs upon graduation.
