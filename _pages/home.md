Welcome!
======
Iâ€™m William Thyer. I work remotely as a data scientist in Chicago, IL. I earned my PhD in Neuroscience from the University of Chicago in 2023. I've spent the last 8 years solving difficult problems with data and machine learning. I like cognitive science, bicycles, remote work, and cities.
