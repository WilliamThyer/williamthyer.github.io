About me
======
My name is William Thyer. I am a 4th year PhD studying psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and data science. I'm a member of the [Awh/Vogel Lab](https://awhvogellab.com) at the University of Chicago. I was a data science intern at [Spark Neuro](https://medical.sparkneuro.com/) in 2021. And I'm doing another data science internship at [Intuitive Surgical](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us) this summer. You can access my [resume here](http://williamthyer.github.io/files/Thyer_William_Resume.pdf) and [CV here](http://williamthyer.github.io/files/thyer_william_cv.pdf).

Background
======
I completed a BS in Psychology with a minor in Statistics at Florida State University. While there, I studied working memory and cognitive control in the [Nee Lab](https://neelab.wixsite.com/neelab). This is where I first gained an interest in cognitive neuroscience, programming, and data science.

Current work
======
I started my PhD in the summer of 2018. My academic research involves designing and conducting experiments to better understand human memory and attention. I am also interested in developing open-source tools to aid psychological research. My internship experience focused on developing machine learning tools and data visualizations to detect and monitor human neurological disorders.
