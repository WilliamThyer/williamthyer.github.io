About me
======
My name is William Thyer. I am a senior data scientist at a healthcare technology company. I received my PhD in Psychology at the University of Chicago in 2023. I was previously a data science intern at [Spark Neuro](https://medical.sparkneuro.com/) in 2021 and at [Intuitive Surgical](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us) in 2022. You can access my [resume here](http://williamthyer.github.io/files/Thyer_William_Resume.pdf) and [Github here](https://github.com/WilliamThyer).

My research and internships
======
My academic research involved designing and conducting experiments to better understand human memory and attention. I worked in the [Awh/Vogel Lab](https://awhvogellab.com) as a researcher from 2018-2023. I have developed open-source data analysis software for psychology and neuroscience research. My internship at Spark Neuro focused on developing machine learning tools and data visualizations to detect and monitor human neurological disorders. In my internship at Intuitive Surgical, I developed machine learning-based systems for providing feedback to surgeons during robotic surgeries.
