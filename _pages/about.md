Who are you?
======
My name is William Thyer. I'm currently doing my PhD in Psychology with a focus in Integrative Neuroscience. I'm a member of the Awh/Vogel Lab at the University of Chicago. 

What is your background?
======
I completed a BS in Psychology with a minor in Statistics at Florida State University. While there, I studied working memory and cognitive control in the Nee Lab. This is where I first gained an interest in cognitive neuroscience and programming.

What do you do now?
------
I started my PhD in the summer of 2018. My research is currently focused on "decoding" visual working memory load from EEG signal using machine learning techniques. I am also interested in developing more sensitive methods for EEG classification using neural networks. 

What is this site for?
------
This site is a platform for me to share some of the work I am doing, whether it’s academic or just for fun. I hope that you can use it as a place to learn a bit about who I am and what I do. If you’re interested, check back in to keep up-to-date about what I’m working on!

How do I contact you?
------
The best way to reach me is through my email (thyer@uchicago.edu). To look at my code, you can check out my [github page](https://github.com/WilliamThyer). I also have an active [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WThyer) (@WThyer) where I post updates of my research and blog posts.
