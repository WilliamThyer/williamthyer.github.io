About me
======
I’m William Thyer, a Senior Data Scientist at [Cohere Health](https://coherehealth.com/). I have 8 years of experience solving difficult problems with data and maching learning. I earned my PhD in Neuroscience from the University of Chicago in 2023. Before that, I interned at [Spark Neuro](https://sparkneuro.com/) in 2021 and [Intuitive Surgical](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us) in 2022. Here is my [resume](https://williamthyer.github.io/files/Thyer_William_Resume.pdf), [portfolio](https://williamthyer.github.io/portfolio/), [Github](https://github.com/WilliamThyer), [Google Scholar](https://williamthyer.github.io/publications/), and [blog](https://williamthyer.github.io/blog/).

My experience
======
Since 2023, I have worked at Cohere Health as a data scientist. I trained, deployed, and monitored a suite of ML models that have approved hundreds of thousands of insurance prior auth requests. I also engineered data assets that inform executive decision-making and support product development.

From 2018–2023, I worked in the [Awh/Vogel Lab](https://awhvogellab.com/) using machine learning to understand human memory. I conducted experiments, built open-source analysis tools, and published papers in research journals.

At Spark Neuro, I developed machine learning tools and visualizations to detect and monitor neurological disorders. At Intuitive Surgical, I built ML systems to provide real-time feedback to surgeons during robotic surgery training.
