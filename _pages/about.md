About me
======
My name is William Thyer. I'm a data science intern at SparkNeuro. I'm also currently doing my PhD in Psychology with a focus in Integrative Neuroscience. I'm a member of the Awh/Vogel Lab at the University of Chicago. You can access my [resume here](http://williamthyer.github.io/files/Thyer_William_Resume.pdf) and [CV here](http://williamthyer.github.io/files/thyer_william_cv.pdf).

Background
======
I completed a BS in Psychology with a minor in Statistics at Florida State University. While there, I studied working memory and cognitive control in the Nee Lab. This is where I first gained an interest in cognitive neuroscience and programming.

Current work
======
I started my PhD in the summer of 2018. My research is currently focused on "decoding" visual working memory load from EEG signal using machine learning techniques. I am also interested in developing more sensitive methods for EEG classification using neural networks. I'm currently doing a summer data science internship at SparkNeuro where I use artificial intelligence to diagnose and monitor neurological disorders.
